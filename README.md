The purpose of the app: The app is created to tell the weather temps and the weater conditions for local residents.
The app is only able to help local residents, so any one who isnt a local resident will find this app as useless.
I gave the app a light purple background design. While, giving it purple button background.As i was coding, i limked my work to Github. I kept pushing it onto my Github and adding commits as i worked.
The flowchart:
1. Start (circle)
2. Press the start button to proceed forward (square)
3. Add the min and max temp (paralellogram)
4. If you consider to leave the app at this piont, you can press the exit button (diamond)
5. Press the detailed button to show all the final information (square)
6. Press the detailed info button to view the condition. (square)
7. Depends on the min and max, the condition will vary (Paralellogram)
